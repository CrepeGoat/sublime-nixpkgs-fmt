Changes:

  * support for newer `rustfmt`
  * simpler and faster update of the view buffer

1.

Newer `rustfmt` requires `--emit=stdout` instead of `--write-mode=display`. The plugin uses the new arguments by default. If you have an older version and don't want to update, add this to the plugin settings:

```sublime-settings
  "legacy_write_mode_option": true,
```

2.

Finally found a working way to save/restore scroll position in Sublime. Now, the plugin simply replaces the entire view buffer with the output of `rustfmt`, preserving the scroll position, instead of the ridiculously convoluted diffing algorithm used before. Should be more reliable and faster. If there are any regressions, let me know.
