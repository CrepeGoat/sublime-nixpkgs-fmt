1. No mandatory subprocess flags. (Potentially breaking.)

Previously, the plugin always passed some flags to the subprocess: either
`["--emit", "stdout"]` or `["--write-mode", "display"]`. This could interfere
with a custom executable setting. It also seems unnecessary for the current
version of rustfmt (1.0.0 at the time of writing), which uses
stdin/stdout/stderr by default.

This version has no mandatory flags. Optional flags are controlled by
`legacy_write_mode_option` and `use_config_path`. Should be more flexible and
less conflict-prone.

This should just work for anyone with a recent version of rustfmt. For older
versions, you may need this setting:

    "executable": ["rustfmt", "--emit", "stdout"]

Alternatively, raise an issue at https://github.com/Mitranim/sublime-rust-fmt.

2. No mandatory hotkeys.

To avoid potential conflicts, this plugin no longer comes with hotkeys. To
hotkey the format command, add something like this to your `.sublime-keymap`:

```sublime-keymap
{
    "keys": ["ctrl+super+k"],
    "command": "rust_fmt_format_buffer",
    "context": [
        {
            "key": "selector",
            "operator": "equal",
            "operand": "source.rust"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Don't ignore rustfmt warnings.

When rustfmt exits with code 0, it may still print warnings to stderr.
Previously, they were ignored. Now they're printed to Sublime's console.
