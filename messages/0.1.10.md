Better formatting method!

This reverts to the method used before `0.1.6`: diff the contents of the view and the formatted output, and modify the view as little as possible. This avoids or minimizes cursor and scroll jumping.

If you notice any issues, you can revert to the old method:

```sublime-settings
  "merge_type": "replace"
```

Or better yet, open an issue via https://github.com/mitranim/sublime-rust-fmt/issues and let me know!
